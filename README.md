# LicensePlateRecognition
Automated system that recognizes Greek License Plates in a video and using OCR it runs the plates through [OpenCar](https://www.gov.gr/ipiresies/polites-kai-kathemerinoteta/metakineseis/opencar) to check if the car is stolen or not insured.

Add the path to your video on `tracking.py`

Run `main.py`
